          "content": "The event loop is responsible for managing asynchronous tasks by listening for and dispatching events. It handles multiple I/O, networking, and file operations without blocking the system. The loop is central to the architecture, ensuring high throughput and low latency during event processing."

Non-functionally, it guarantees scalability by allowing the system to handle multiple events concurrently. It interacts with almost all components, coordinating the execution flow and triggering events when necessary."

        {
          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "The event loop interacts with components like I/O managers, network handlers, and thread managers. These components raise events that the loop listens to, processes, and forwards to appropriate callbacks. The loop is designed to manage multiple events in parallel, ensuring optimal performance across different tasks."

They ensure that I/O tasks do not hinder the responsiveness of the system. They interact closely with the event loop, which listens for events raised by I/O tasks and then forwards those events to appropriate callback functions."
