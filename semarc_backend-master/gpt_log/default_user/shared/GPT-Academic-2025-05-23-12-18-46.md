          "content": "Functionality: The client-side application in Java interacts with the native C++ components via JNI bindings or RPC communication. It initiates requests for file handling, encryption, compression, or other operations within the Hadoop ecosystem. The application abstracts the complexities of the underlying native code, providing a high-level interface to the user."

It must also exhibit strong cross-platform compatibility, supporting both Windows and Unix-like systems. Additionally, the application should be scalable and fault-tolerant to handle communication with distributed systems efficiently."

It also interacts with the Hadoop ecosystem, including HDFS and YARN, and uses RPC mechanisms for secure, authenticated communication (e.g., with SASL). Configuration management and error handling are mediated by the broker, ensuring consistent operation across various deployment environments."

It manages resources within the distributed environment (such as HDFS and YARN containers) and communicates asynchronously with the client via RPC or JNI proxies. Error handling, logging, and system state management are coordinated through the broker to maintain smooth operation."
