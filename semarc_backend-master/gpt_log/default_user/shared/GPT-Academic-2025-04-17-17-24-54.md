          "content": "The Broker component serves as the intermediary between clients and servers. Its main responsibility is to route requests from clients to the appropriate servers and return the responses. It functions as the central controller of the system, ensuring that the flow of communication is handled efficiently and correctly. It abstracts the server-side complexity from the clients, making it simpler for clients to interact with the system."
        },
        {
          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "The Broker is highly scalable and flexible, allowing the system to grow by adding more servers or services without needing changes to client-side logic. It can handle dynamic routing based on factors such as load balancing, server availability, and type of service requested. Additionally, it can be extended to support new types of communication protocols or services without disturbing the existing communication flow."

          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "The Broker interacts with all clients and servers in the system, directing requests and responses accordingly. Clients communicate exclusively with the Broker, while servers provide services through the Broker. This centralization simplifies management and maintenance, as changes in server configurations or services do not affect the clients directly."

          "content": "The Client component initiates requests for services but does not interact directly with servers. Instead, clients send requests to the Broker, which processes them and forwards them to the appropriate server. Clients are unaware of which server will process their request, ensuring flexibility in how the system scales or evolves over time."

They are decoupled from the server-side logic, allowing for easier maintenance and the ability to scale independently. The client-side functionality remains unchanged even as new servers or services are added to the system."

The decoupling between clients and servers enhances system flexibility, ensuring that clients do not need to be aware of backend changes."

Each server is responsible for handling specific types of requests and performing the necessary actions to fulfill those requests. Servers are not directly aware of clients but only interact with the Broker."

        {
          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "Servers can scale independently, as new servers can be introduced to handle different types of services or increase capacity. The system can manage various server configurations and types without affecting the clients. This decoupling provides flexibility and ensures that servers can evolve without disrupting client communication."

        {
          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "Servers interact only with the Broker and provide their responses through it. They do not know the client that made the request, making the architecture highly modular. The interaction with the Broker ensures that the server’s internal processes and configurations are abstracted from the clients, allowing for easier changes and updates on the server side."
