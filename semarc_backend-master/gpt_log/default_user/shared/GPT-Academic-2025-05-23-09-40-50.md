          "content": "The Broker component is responsible for mediating communication between clients and services. It receives requests from clients and routes them to the appropriate service. The broker also handles service discovery, ensuring that clients do not need to know the physical location of services, thus abstracting the complexity of communication."

          "content": "Non-functionally, the Broker ensures the system can scale dynamically and can isolate faults. It provides scalability by handling requests from multiple clients and routing them to services as needed. It also enables fault isolation as failures in one service do not directly impact others, maintaining system integrity."

          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "The Broker interacts with all other components (clients and services). It serves as the intermediary between them, routing messages and requests based on the service availability and client needs. It also handles dynamic service discovery, allowing components to scale or move without client awareness."

Clients are typically independent and unaware of the services' location, relying on the Broker for communication. They initiate requests that are routed through the Broker to appropriate services."

It does not need to be aware of the service details, supporting flexibility and ease of maintenance. Its non-functional requirements include minimal latency in communication with the Broker and the ability to handle service discovery through it."

          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "Services are designed to be highly modular and scalable, offering specific tasks without coupling directly to other components. Their performance requirements are linked to the ability to scale in response to client demand. The service should support flexible deployment strategies across various infrastructures."

          "content": "Services communicate with the Broker for both request reception and response delivery. The Broker routes requests to the appropriate service, and the service communicates the results back to the Broker, which then sends them to the client. This decoupling ensures that services remain independent of the clients."
