        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "The separation of responsibilities between layers promotes modularity, allowing individual components to be developed, tested, and maintained separately without affecting other parts of the application."},
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "Modularity enhances productivity through a focus on individual components rather than the entire software suite at once. This approach also improves system understanding and maintenance by clearly delineating each functional area."}

      "nested": [
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "The feature processing layer is responsible for executing specific NLP-related operations, including tokenization and part-of-speech tagging. This specialization allows for greater efficiency in these tasks without needing broad system knowledge."},
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "By focusing on a single type of operation within the larger context of an NLP application, this layer can be optimized to handle very large amounts of text data efficiently while reducing computational overhead and processing time."},
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "This specialization also makes it easier to introduce new features or updates in feature processing without affecting other parts of the system like stack management or model training, as they operate independently within their respective layers."}

      "nested": [
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "The stack management layer is designed to handle higher-level system operations such as memory allocation and task scheduling, ensuring that lower layers like the feature processing layer can function effectively."},
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "By focusing on tasks related to handling software stacks and processes, this layer provides necessary support for other functions without becoming entangled in detailed feature execution."},
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "This layer is crucial for maintaining system stability by managing resource allocation at a more abstract level than lower layers like the feature processing. This ensures that higher-level operations have access to required resources while preventing overconsumption or underutilization of these resources across different functional areas."}
