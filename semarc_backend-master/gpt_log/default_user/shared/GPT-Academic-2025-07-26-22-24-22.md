 The summary will not include exact code syntax but instead provide a high-level overview of what is needed for your task. It may take assistance from various parts of the text, hence you need to understand it in bits before making a final conclusion:

1) Parses parameters: This part reads and processes input file(s) or command line arguments to set up configurations required for running tests. 
   
2) Generates test cases automatically: Using these parsed settings (e.g., input data, expected outputs), this module writes code that generates test cases based on a specified template. The generated files are typically scripts of some kind which could run other tools or libraries to perform testing operations.
    
3) Runs tests remotely: With configured information in place from steps 1 & 2 above, the tool executes these tests against remote systems using appropriate protocols (like SSH for Linux-based environments).
   
4) Returns test results: Finally, it collects and returns results after each execution of a generated test case. This typically includes not just whether or not an individual test passed but also possibly additional metadata like timings etc.
  
Based on these high-level description elements, we can infer that the main functionality of this module revolves around configuring tests (including generating them), executing those against remote targets and then capturing/reporting results back. 

For naming this module based on directory terms, it could be "TestCaseGeneratr". This name represents testing activity which aligns with generated test cases operation as indicated in descriptions above.

 1. Checks for fixup tests in specific directories or files.
   - This function likely involves searching for test scripts that utilize "fixup" mechanisms to modify system configurations, typically used for automating fixes after changes are made.

2. Verifies correct behavior of automated system configuration modifications.
   - The module may include routines to ensure that the fixups applied actually have the intended effect without causing unintended side-effects or errors in the system being configured.

3. Identifies when a test fails, often by comparing expected vs actual system state after applying various fixes.
   - This involves setting up test environments where manual alterations can be made to configurations and then programmatically observing how changes propagate through automation scripts.

4. Logs failures or other significant findings for reporting purposes.
   - The module should capture detailed logs that describe the state of systems before, during, and after applying fixups. These logs are critical for diagnosing when tests fail due to incorrect implementations or incompatibilities with current system states.

5. Potentially supports command-line utilities for initiating these test runs manually or as part of larger build processes.
   - This function might allow users to execute predefined sets of fixup tests, facilitating comprehensive checks across multiple configurations at once without requiring manual intervention each time a new configuration is created.

Considering the above descriptions and keeping in mind that the name should be succinct yet descriptive, an appropriate module title could be: "AutoFixVerify". This reflects both automated nature (auto) of its functioning as well as verifications being performed to ensure proper fixup behavior within system configurations.
