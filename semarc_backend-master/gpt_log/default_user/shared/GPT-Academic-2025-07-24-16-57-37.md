        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "An issue or vulnerability in one part of the layered architecture doesn't immediately compromise other parts since they are separate functional entities with specific interfaces for interaction."},
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "This enhances the robustness against security threats and allows better control over permissions without compromising other system functionalities."}

        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "This is beneficial as it allows for incremental enhancements based on specific project needs without causing significant disruptions to the entire system."},
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "It also aids in managing different functionalities and updates effectively, maintaining efficiency throughout development cycles."}
