 Based on the provided filenames and their location within the project directory, it appears that this module is likely responsible for splitting sentences into smaller segments or handling sentence structures in some way. The main functionality can be summarized as follows:

1. **Sentence Splitting**: This part of the module deals with breaking down a full sentence into multiple parts (sentences). It may involve detecting where one sentence ends and another begins, which could include checking punctuation and grammar rules to accurately identify sentences in text data.

2. **Handling Sentence Structures**: The functionality might also extend beyond mere splitting; it could potentially analyze the structure of sentences after they are split to ensure coherence or adhere to certain language rules. This analysis could be used for improving readability, maintaining grammatical correctness, or facilitating other NLP tasks such as paraphrasing and summarization.
