        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "The layered architecture is divided into distinct layers or segments, each encapsulating a specific functionality or set of functions. This allows for individual functionalities to be developed and managed separately."},
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "Modularity: Each layer provides isolation from other layers through well-defined interfaces that allow communication between them. Changes in one layer do not significantly affect others, ensuring stability and reliability in the system."},
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "Focus: With a clear separation of functionalities in distinct layers, developers can focus more deeply on specific areas without being distracted by other concerns outside their immediate area of specialization. This deep focus leads to higher quality development for each layer compared to a less structured approach."}

      "nested": [
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "The Shell Scripting and Terminal Operations layer is particularly well-suited for the functionality of Unix/Linux systems, as it allows for modular development by separating different functionalities into distinct layers."},
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "Scalability: The layered architecture supports scalability in that new functionalities or adjustments to existing ones can be implemented easily without affecting other layers significantly. This flexibility is crucial when adapting the software for diverse environments and user needs."},
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "Flexibility: Modifications in one layer of this architecture pattern do not usually affect others, allowing developers to work independently while maintaining coherence with the overall system design. This enables efficient development practices and adaptability as requirements evolve over time."}
