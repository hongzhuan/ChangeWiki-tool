          "content": "The Client component is responsible for initiating requests to services and receiving responses. It acts as the interface through which the user or other system components interact with the distributed system. Functionally, the client requests specific services from the broker, which forwards these requests to the appropriate server. Non-functionally, the client must ensure low-latency interactions and be efficient in handling data, especially when dealing with complex file monitoring or real-time operations. Interaction with other components occurs through the intermediary broker, ensuring that the client does not need to know the actual location of the service being requested."
        },
        {
          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "From a performance standpoint, clients need to be optimized to minimize unnecessary overhead when sending requests or receiving responses. The client must also manage multiple types of interactions, including synchronous and asynchronous communications, which can impact the system’s overall response time and resource management. The client communicates indirectly with server components, relying on the broker for load balancing and service discovery, which simplifies its implementation and allows for more scalable and flexible integration."

          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "The client is independent of the backend services and interacts only with the broker, ensuring loose coupling between the client and server components. This abstraction is essential in distributed systems where the backend services may change without impacting the client. The client can also be designed to handle multiple types of service requests, such as database queries or memory allocation operations, without the need for direct communication with these services."

          "content": "The Broker component is the central intermediary in the system, responsible for routing requests from clients to the appropriate servers or services. It manages service discovery, load balancing, and request forwarding. Functionally, the broker is the core communication hub that enables indirect interaction between all components. Non-functionally, it must be scalable, highly available, and able to handle varying load efficiently. The broker should also be able to support fault tolerance and ensure seamless communication in a distributed setup."

          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "The broker is designed to handle high-throughput operations, balancing requests across servers and ensuring that clients are connected to the appropriate services without delay. Additionally, it handles error and exception management, retrying failed requests and notifying the client about issues in service availability. The broker interacts with both the client and server components, forwarding requests and responses as needed while maintaining the system’s modular architecture."

          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "The broker ensures that components are decoupled, so clients do not need to know the physical location or details of the backend services. It acts as the mediator for communication, supporting various proxy implementations to manage high-performance services like database connections, file compression, and memory management. This enables the system to maintain flexibility, as the broker can dynamically route requests to different services based on current conditions, such as load or availability."

          "content": "The Server component represents the services or servers that process client requests forwarded by the broker. It includes specialized services like database management, file monitoring, memory management, or data parsing. Functionally, servers are designed to handle specific tasks, such as querying a database or compressing files, based on the client’s request. Non-functionally, servers need to be optimized for performance, ensuring that they can handle potentially resource-intensive operations without introducing significant delays. The server does not need to be aware of the client’s identity or location but must understand how to respond appropriately to broker instructions."

        {
          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "The server is built for high efficiency and may need to support heavy loads, especially when handling large data sets or performing complex computations. To achieve this, servers often implement optimized algorithms or cache strategies to improve performance. Server interactions with other components are mediated entirely through the broker, allowing the system to remain flexible and adaptable to different workloads. Servers are also expected to work efficiently with proxies that encapsulate their complex behavior, making interactions with clients seamless and lightweight."
        },
        {
          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "Servers depend on the broker for service discovery, meaning they do not need to know about the clients that will be interacting with them. The broker abstracts away the client-server relationship, allowing servers to focus purely on their functional tasks. Additionally, servers often include proxy-based mechanisms to interact with the broker and manage responses, ensuring that the server-side complexity is hidden from clients and facilitating easy integration with the rest of the system."

It provides the necessary abstraction layers for high-performance services, such as database connections or memory management utilities. Functionally, the proxy simplifies interactions by providing a lightweight interface to the client and server, handling complex tasks like data serialization or caching. Non-functionally, proxies must ensure minimal overhead and fast response times, especially in resource-intensive tasks. Their primary role is to optimize communication without introducing significant delays."

          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "Proxies play a key role in improving system performance by ensuring that clients interact with servers without directly invoking complex operations. This abstraction reduces the amount of processing required on the client-side and helps servers manage resources more efficiently. From an interaction perspective, proxies act as a bridge, relaying requests and responses between clients and servers while ensuring that both sides can focus on their primary tasks without concern for low-level details."

On the client side, proxies manage requests and ensure they are forwarded to the broker with minimal overhead. On the server side, proxies ensure that the server responses are formatted correctly and sent back through the broker, maintaining the system's modularity and efficiency. The proxy's key benefit lies in minimizing the resource usage and improving system scalability."
