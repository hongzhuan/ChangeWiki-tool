   - Provides cryptographically secure random number generation using system calls like `getrandom`, `/dev/random`, and `sysctl`, ensuring secure random data retrieval across platforms.

6. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Includes tests for verifying the correct operation of various synchronization primitives, system calls, and functionality such as event loop behavior, file system event detection, memory statistics retrieval, and random number generation.

### Suggested English Module Name:
**"Libuv Unix Platform Support and Synchronization"** 

This name captures the core focus on providing platform-specific functionality for various Unix-like systems (Linux, BSD, AIX, etc.) while also emphasizing the synchronization and event handling features that are central to the module's functionality.

## 正在总结模块 7 的第 1/1 个片段。

### 主要功能总结：
该模块主要负责执行和管理针对libuv库的功能和稳定性测试。它确保库在不同平台和使用案例下的正确行为，包括：
1. 初始化和执行测试。
2. 管理平台特定的进程执行、监控和同步。
3. 处理不同平台（如Unix和Windows）上的测试环境，确保测试框架的兼容性。
4. 收集、管理和报告测试结果。

### 英文名称建议：
**TestRunner Module** or **Test Suite Manager**

这两个名称都能够反映模块管理和执行测试的核心功能。如果强调跨平台支持，可以使用**Cross-Platform Test Runner**。
