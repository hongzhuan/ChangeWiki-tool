It includes all the necessary logic and data models for its domain. Services operate independently, with clear boundaries between them, which ensures ease of modifications and additions over time."

          "content": "Non-Functional Characteristics: The component is independently deployable, ensuring minimal downtime during updates. It uses a dedicated database and can scale horizontally based on demand, optimizing resource usage. Fault tolerance measures, like retries and circuit breakers, ensure that failures in this component don't affect the entire system."

It may depend on other services for certain operations, such as authentication or payment processing, but it does not directly share data with other components. Interactions are stateless, ensuring flexibility and ease of communication."

It handles containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) to ensure that microservices are deployed and maintained in a reliable and efficient manner. It includes monitoring, logging, and automated scaling capabilities."

It may also interact with cloud services for resource management or service discovery to dynamically allocate resources. Furthermore, it communicates with monitoring systems to track service performance and health."

It includes authentication, authorization, encryption, and API gateway functions. The API gateway handles routing requests from clients to the appropriate microservice, while the security component ensures data protection across all services."

It also includes rate limiting and load balancing features to protect the services from abuse or overloading. Fault isolation and failover mechanisms ensure that security breaches or failures in this component do not impact the overall system."

It maintains separate databases for each microservice, allowing for independent scaling and management of data. The component includes CRUD operations for data access and may support eventual consistency for distributed data."

While the component does not share databases, it can interact with other microservices through APIs to synchronize or share specific data as required by the business logic. Transactions across services are managed through eventual consistency or asynchronous messaging, avoiding tight coupling."
