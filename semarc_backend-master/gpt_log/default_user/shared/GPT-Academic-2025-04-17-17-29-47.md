Its core functionality is to mediate and route requests from clients to appropriate servers, handling the complexity of server interactions. It abstracts the client-server communication, making the system more modular and adaptable to changes in the server infrastructure."

Non-functionally, it enables dynamic service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance, providing scalability without disrupting client operations. The broker also manages error handling and logging in a centralized manner."

It receives requests from clients and routes them to the appropriate server based on availability, location, or other criteria. It ensures that servers are not directly aware of client details, and vice versa, simplifying the communication flow."
