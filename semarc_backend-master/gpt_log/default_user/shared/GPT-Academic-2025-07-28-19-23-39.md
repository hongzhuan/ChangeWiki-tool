    {
      "nested": [
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "Each layer in the architecture is designed to handle distinct tasks such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. This specialization allows for focused development and efficiency in each task."},
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "The separation of concerns at different layers means that changes or updates can be made independently without affecting other components within the project, enhancing flexibility and maintainability."},
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "Modularity is a key characteristic of this architecture. Each layer functions as an independent module, facilitating the reuse of specific functionalities across different NLP projects, which also aids in reducing development time and effort."}

    },
    {
      "nested": [
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "This layer is responsible for the initial data ingestion, preprocessing, and cleaning tasks. It acts as a foundation layer ensuring that all input data meets required standards before further processing."},
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "Non-functional characteristics of this component include robustness to different data formats and ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data efficiently, supporting the project's scalability requirements."},
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "Interactions with other components are primarily through outputting clean, preprocessed datasets that feed into feature engineering layers for further processing."}

      "nested": [
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "This layer focuses on the creation and extraction of features crucial for model training, such as word embeddings or part-of-speech tags. It is designed to adapt quickly to new NLP techniques."},
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "Efficiency in feature engineering allows for reduced time from data collection to ready-for-training datasets, enhancing the project's ability to iterate and improve models rapidly as technology advances."},
        {"@type": "indicator", "content": "Interactions with other layers involve sharing processed features that are needed for training different predictive models. This ensures a consistent flow of information necessary for model performance improvement across all stages of data handling."}
      ],
      "@type": "component",
      "name": "Model Training Layer"
