        {
          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "The broker acts as an intermediary between clients and servers, facilitating communication without the need for them to be directly connected. It handles message routing, ensuring that requests from clients reach the appropriate server without exposing location details. This abstraction allows clients to send requests seamlessly, relying on the broker to manage communication details."
        },
        {
          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "Functionally, the broker centralizes all communication activities, which simplifies the architecture, particularly in distributed systems. It provides dynamic message routing capabilities based on the type of request, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in communication. The broker can also implement load balancing strategies to efficiently distribute requests among multiple servers."
        },
        {
          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "In terms of interactions, the broker communicates directly with all clients and servers in the system. Clients only interact with the broker; they do not need to be aware of each other's existence. Servers respond to requests initiated by clients through the broker, creating a clear separation of roles within the architecture."

      "nested": [
        {
          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "Clients are end-user applications or services that initiate requests for operations or data. They rely on the broker to handle communication details and route their requests to the appropriate servers, thus focusing solely on their functionalities rather than the intricacies of networked interactions. Clients can vary in type, including web applications, mobile apps, or background services."
        },
        {
          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "Non-functionally, clients are characterized by their independence and ability to operate with minimal coupling to other components. This loose coupling allows for easier updates and maintenance of client applications without affecting other system parts. Clients can also be developed and deployed by different teams or updated with different technologies, further enhancing modularity."
        },
        {
          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "Clients interact exclusively with the broker to send requests and receive responses. They do not need to know which server will handle their request, allowing them to stay focused on their specific tasks. This centralized interaction model minimizes the complexity of client-side development and enhances the overall user experience."

          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "Servers are responsible for processing requests that are routed through the broker. Each server implements specific business logic or data processing functionalities, responding to the requests made by clients. Servers can also hold and manage datasets, serving as the backbone for data retrieval and storage."
        },
        {
          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "From a non-functional perspective, servers in this architecture are designed to scale independently based on demand. This means individual servers can be added or upgraded without impacting the entire system. The system can dynamically allocate resources to servers, promoting efficient operation during peak loads."
        },
        {
          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "Servers interact with the broker exclusively, receiving requests for data or operations and sending responses back through the broker. This ensures that they are decoupled from clients, simplifying how services are managed and allowing changes to server implementations without disrupting client applications."
