This allows the client to remain unaware of the server's physical location, facilitating indirect communication. The client initiates requests for services but does not handle the details of how these requests are processed or routed."

The client must be flexible enough to interact with any server without knowing its physical location, ensuring that the system can evolve without disrupting client behavior."

The server handles the actual processing of requests but does not directly interact with the client, ensuring that the client's communication details are abstracted away. This design allows the server to focus on providing its functionality without worrying about managing individual client interactions."

The server's interaction with clients is mediated through the communication layer provided by the broker."

It acts as a mediator, receiving client requests and forwarding them to the appropriate server, as well as managing the return of the server's response back to the client. The broker ensures that clients and servers are decoupled and can evolve independently."

This abstraction supports scalability, flexibility, and robustness. The broker’s performance must be optimized to handle potentially large volumes of communication between clients and servers."

It manages service requests and ensures that responses are properly routed. The broker is a central component that ties together the entire system by abstracting the details of client-server communication."

The proxy ensures that communication between the client and the server occurs smoothly without either party needing to know the other's physical location."

It also reduces the complexity of client-server communication by providing a simplified interface. The proxy needs to ensure minimal latency while forwarding requests and responses."
