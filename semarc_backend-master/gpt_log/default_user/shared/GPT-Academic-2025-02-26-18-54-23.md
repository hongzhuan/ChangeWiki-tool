          "content": "The master component is responsible for centralized control. It orchestrates task assignment to the slave nodes based on the required workload. It ensures that tasks are properly distributed, maintaining high-level decision-making and task allocation. It typically includes logic for managing system states and task priorities."
        },

          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "Non-functional characteristics include high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability. The master node must be designed for reliability, ensuring it doesn't become a single point of failure. It also needs to scale horizontally, meaning that it should be able to manage an increasing number of slave nodes and tasks without performance degradation."

          "content": "The master interacts with slave nodes by sending task instructions and receiving status updates or results. It communicates with slave components via a network connection, ensuring low-latency and high-throughput data transfer. In case of failure of a slave node, the master reassigns tasks to other nodes to maintain system stability."

          "content": "The slave components are responsible for executing the tasks assigned by the master. Each slave performs specific, independent operations in parallel, ensuring the scalability of the system. The slaves may perform computational tasks, data processing, or manage portions of a larger distributed dataset."

Their performance is closely tied to the number of slaves in the system, which means adding more slaves can increase overall throughput and performance."

This interaction typically happens through a network interface, where the slave nodes report progress, errors, or results. Communication efficiency is key, as any lag in reporting or task completion can reduce system performance."

It ensures that no single slave is overburdened with too many tasks, which could lead to delays or failure in processing. The load balancer can also prioritize certain types of tasks depending on the slave node's capabilities."

The load balancer must ensure minimal latency in task allocation and be able to reassign tasks if a slave fails. It should also be scalable, meaning it should efficiently handle an increasing number of slaves or requests from the master."

It receives task allocation instructions from the master and assigns tasks to slaves based on their current load or availability. It ensures tasks are evenly distributed across the system to maintain optimal performance."

It ensures that the system can efficiently manage large volumes of data with minimal delays. This component typically includes protocols and data serialization mechanisms optimized for parallel task execution."

The communication infrastructure must be designed to handle frequent message passing between the master and slave nodes without causing delays that could reduce system performance. It should also ensure secure data transfer between components."

It also communicates with the load balancer to ensure proper task assignment and feedback from slaves. The communication layer must support high-frequency message passing while minimizing overhead."
