          "content": "The Broker component acts as an intermediary between clients and servers, ensuring communication is routed effectively without clients needing to know about the server's location or specifics. It is responsible for managing service discovery and request routing, enabling flexibility in how clients interact with servers. By abstracting the details of the server-side architecture, it simplifies communication between clients and servers, especially in distributed environments."

          "content": "The Broker is highly scalable, as it can manage a growing number of clients and services by dynamically routing requests to available servers. It also offers robustness by maintaining transparency, allowing clients to communicate without knowledge of the infrastructure. The broker decouples components, enabling servers to be added, removed, or modified without disrupting the system’s overall functionality."

It also communicates with servers for service discovery and availability status updates. The broker acts as the central mediator, ensuring that all interactions between clients and servers are seamless and transparent."

The Client does not need to know the physical location or details of the servers, allowing for a more abstract and simplified interaction. It focuses solely on the service it requires, leaving the complexities of communication management to the Broker."

This decoupling ensures that the client can be easily updated or scaled without concerns about the backend infrastructure. Clients rely on the Broker for service discovery and communication, which ensures greater maintainability and modularity."

The Client also receives responses from the Broker, with no direct awareness of the server-side architecture or communication protocols."

They expose functionality that can be accessed through requests routed by the Broker, meaning they do not need to directly manage client communications. Servers focus on executing the services required by the client, without concern for the client’s location or the specifics of the client’s request format."

The system architecture allows servers to scale independently from the clients, maintaining high availability and fault tolerance. Servers only need to communicate with the Broker to maintain their registration and handle incoming requests."
