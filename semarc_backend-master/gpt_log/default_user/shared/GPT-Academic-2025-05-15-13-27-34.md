      "name": "libuv_utilities",
      "description": "Primarily focuses on testing, implementing, and benchmarking various functionalities related to libuv, string manipulation, and system operations. It includes tests for TCP/UDP networking, signal handling, child processes, thread management, and I/O operations, ensuring proper behavior, performance, and safety. Additionally, it implements custom string tokenization, safe string copying, and system-specific features (e.g., OS/390 support)."

      "name": "libuv_tests",
      "description": "The main functionality of this module is to test and verify the behavior of various libuv components under different conditions. These tests cover scenarios involving UDP, TCP, file system monitoring, event loops, thread safety, error handling, and integration with embedded environments. The module ensures that libuv handles tasks such as sending data, managing file descriptors, scheduling timers, interacting with the OS, and processing events correctly and efficiently."

      "name": "async_operations",
      "description": "The module primarily focuses on testing and managing asynchronous operations, multi-threading, and network protocols using the libuv library. It ensures proper synchronization, error handling, and resource management in various environments, including TCP connections, IPv4/IPv6 handling, file operations, and domain name encoding/decoding. The functionality spans across multi-threading and synchronization (semaphores, mutexes, thread pools), error handling for network and I/O operations (TCP, write failures, connection errors), network protocol management (IPv4, IPv6, multicast, IDNA), event loop management (timers, performance metrics), asynchronous I/O operations (file descriptors, standard input/output), and testing different failure conditions (e.g., memory allocation, write operation failures)."

      "no": 8,
      "name": "platform_io_utils",
      "description": "The module appears to provide platform-specific system utilities and APIs for handling I/O operations, event loops, random data generation, multi-threading, and inter-process communication across different Unix-like systems. It includes functionality for various platforms such as Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, AIX, and others, offering tailored implementations for networking (e.g., UDP, pipes), system calls (e.g., memory management, process control), and event-driven programming (e.g., file descriptor polling, timers). It also includes test files for verifying the correct behavior of various system and event-loop functionalities."
